In fact, it depends on how you use the <code>logging</code> module.

When they need to rotate the file, something strange could happen. (You can refer to the question <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9975609/python-timedrotatingfilehandler-logs-are-missing/9993857#9993857\">Python TimedRotatingFileHandler - logs are missing</a>, which cause by a similar reason)</p>\n<p>Under the hood, in the <code>logging</code> module, each handler instance holds an <code>threading.RLock</code> instance, hence different loggers that hold different handlers will hold different <code>RLock</code>s, so those locks cannot avoid the race condition when loggers try to write to the same file in different threads -- loggers are still able to write bytes at the same time to the same file even they have acquired their own <code>RLock</code>.</p>\n<p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#opening-the-same-log-file-multiple-times\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Logging Cookbook - Opening the same log file multiple times</a> part for more information.</p>\n"
