def weighted_avg_and_std(values, weights):
    """
    Return the weighted average and standard deviation.

    They weights are in effect first normalized so that they 
    sum to 1 (and so they must not all be 0).

    values, weights -- NumPy ndarrays with the same shape.

    average = numpy.average(values, weights=weights)
    # Fast and numerically precise:
    variance = numpy.average((values-average)**2, weights=weights)
    return (average, math.sqrt(variance))
