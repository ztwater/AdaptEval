Here's a first stab at it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if sys.platform=='win32':\n    subprocess.Popen(['start', d], shell= True)\n\nelif sys.platform=='darwin':\n    subprocess.Popen(['open', d])\n\nelse:\n    try:\n        subprocess.Popen(['xdg-open', d])\n    except OSError:\n        # er, think of something else to try\n        # xdg-open *should* be supported by recent Gnome, KDE, Xfce\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note the win32 version will currently fail for spaces in filenames. <a href=\"http://bugs.python.org/issue2304\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bug 2304</a> might be something to do with that, but there does seem to be a basic problem with parameter escaping and the Windows shell (<code>cmd /c ...</code>), in that you can't nest double-quotes and you can't ^-escape quotes or spaces. I haven't managed to find any way to quote and run <code>cmd /c start C:\\Documents and Settings</code> from the command line at all.</p>\n\n<p>ETA re nosklo's comment: on Windows only, there is a built-in way to do it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if sys.platform=='win32':\n    os.startfile(d)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's the not-very-nice alternative solution to find the shell and open a folder with it, which you shouldn't now need, but I'll leave in. (Partly because it might be of use for something else, but mostly because I spent the time to type the damned thing!)</p>\n\n<pre><code>if sys.platform=='win32':\n    import _winreg\n    path= r'SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon')\n    for root in (_winreg.HKEY_CURRENT_USER, _winreg.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE):\n        try:\n            with _winreg.OpenKey(root, path) as k:\n                value, regtype= _winreg.QueryValueEx(k, 'Shell')\n        except WindowsError:\n            pass\n        else:\n            if regtype in (_winreg.REG_SZ, _winreg.REG_EXPAND_SZ):\n                shell= value\n            break\n    else:\n        shell= 'Explorer.exe'\n    subprocess.Popen([shell, d])\n</code></pre>\n"
