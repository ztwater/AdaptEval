M = 1000 must be added, because the following letter C =100 is lower.
C = 100 must be subtracted because the following letter M =1000 is greater.
M = 1000 must be added, because the following letter L = 50 is lower.
L = 50 must be added, because the following letter I =1 is lower.
I = 1 must be subtracted, because the following letter V = 5 is greater.
V = 5 must be added, because there are no more symbols left.
