Then take the vector from <code>P1</code> to your point <code>P0</code> and find <code>(P2-P1) . (P0 - P1)</code> where <code>.</code> is the dot product. Divide this value by <code>||P2-P1||^2</code> and get a value <code>r</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now if you picked <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code> as your points, you can simply check if <code>r</code> is between 0 and 1. If <code>r</code>  is greater than 1, then <code>P2</code> is the closest point, so your distance is <code>||P0-P2||</code>. If <code>r</code> is less than 0, then <code>P1</code> is the closest point, so your distance is <code>||P0-P1||</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If <code>0&lt;r&lt;1</code>, then your distance is <code>sqrt(||P0-P1||^2 - (r * ||P2-P1||)^2)</code></p>\n\n<p>The pseudocode is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for p1, p2 in vertices:\n\n  var r = dotProduct(vector(p2 - p1), vector(x - p1))\n  //x is the point you're looking for\n\n  r /= (magnitude(vector(p2 - p1)) ** 2)\n\n  if r &lt; 0:\n    var dist = magnitude(vector(x - p1))\n  else if r &gt; 1:\n    dist = magnitude(vector(p2 - x))\n  else:\n    dist = sqrt(magnitude(vector(x - p1)) ^ 2 - (r * magnitude(vector(p2-p1))) ^ 2)\n\n  minDist = min(dist,minDist)\n</code></pre>\n"
