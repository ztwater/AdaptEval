If a 2nd click is detected within the timer, process a double-click event. </p>\n\n<p>This can actually be expanded to n-clicks if needed. I've found some uses for triple-click events.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/20992288/1354930\">Here</a> is one implemented in wxPython. Should be relatively easy to port to matplotlib.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Also, if you're on Windows, I would recommend using the user's double-click speed for your timer (Control Panel: Mouse). You can access it with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>get_double_click_time():\n    \"\"\" Gets the Windows double click time in ms \"\"\"\n    from ctypes import windll\n    return int(windll.user32.GetDoubleClickTime())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I haven't yet figured out how to grab the dclick time from Mac or Linux (but I also don't have a need to).</p>\n"

The first time it's with <code>event.dblclick=False</code> and the second time it's with <code>event.dblclick=True</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any solution to this? I saw that the same problem regarding qt is discussed <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4627347/distinguish-between-single-and-double-click-events-in-qt\">here</a>.</p>\n"
