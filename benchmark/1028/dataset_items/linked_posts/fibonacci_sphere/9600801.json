                    "body": "<p><strong>edit:</strong> This does not answer the question the OP meant to ask, leaving it here in case people find it useful somehow.</p>\n\n<p>We use the multiplication rule of probability, combined with infinitessimals. This results in 2 lines of code to achieve your desired result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>longitude: \u03c6 = uniform([0,2pi))\nazimuth:   \u03b8 = -arcsin(1 - 2*uniform([0,1]))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(defined in the following coordinate system:)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EHHKM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Your language typically has a uniform random number primitive. For example in python you can use <code>random.random()</code> to return a number in the range <code>[0,1)</code>. You can multiply this number by k to get a random number in the range <code>[0,k)</code>. Thus in python, <code>uniform([0,2pi))</code> would mean <code>random.random()*2*math.pi</code>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Proof</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now we can't assign \u03b8 uniformly, otherwise we'd get clumping at the poles. We wish to assign probabilities proportional to the surface area of the spherical wedge (the \u03b8 in this diagram is actually \u03c6):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4OHbn.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>An angular displacement d\u03c6 at the equator will result in a displacement of d\u03c6*r. What will that displacement be at an arbitrary azimuth \u03b8? Well, the radius from the z-axis is <code>r*sin(\u03b8)</code>, so the arclength of that \"latitude\" intersecting the wedge is <code>d\u03c6 * r*sin(\u03b8)</code>. Thus we calculate the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cumulative distribution</a> of the area to sample from it, by integrating the area of the slice from the south pole to the north pole.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZGuq.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"> (where stuff=<code>d\u03c6*r</code>)</p>\n\n<p>We will now attempt to get the inverse of the CDF to sample from it: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling</a></p>\n\n<p>First we normalize by dividing our almost-CDF by its maximum value. This has the side-effect of cancelling out the d\u03c6 and r.</p>\n\n<pre><code>azimuthalCDF: cumProb = (sin(\u03b8)+1)/2 from -pi/2 to pi/2\n\ninverseCDF: \u03b8 = -sin^(-1)(1 - 2*cumProb)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let x by a random float in range [0,1]\n\u03b8 = -arcsin(1-2*x)\n</code></pre>\n"

                    "body": "<p>This is known as packing points on a sphere, and there is no (known) general, perfect solution.  However, there are plenty of imperfect solutions.  The three most popular seem to be:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create a simulation</strong>.  Treat each point as an electron constrained to a sphere, then run a simulation for a certain number of steps.  The electrons' repulsion will naturally tend the system to a more stable state, where the points are about as far away from each other as they can get.</li>\n<li><strong>Hypercube rejection</strong>.  This fancy-sounding method is actually really simple:  you uniformly choose points <em>(much more than <code>n</code> of them)</em> inside of the cube surrounding the sphere, then reject the points outside of the sphere.  Treat the remaining points as vectors, and normalize them.  These are your \"samples\" - choose <code>n</code> of them using some method (randomly, greedy, etc).</li>\n<li><strong>Spiral approximations</strong>.  You trace a spiral around a sphere, and evenly-distribute the points around the spiral.  Because of the mathematics involved, these are more complicated to understand than the simulation, but much faster (and probably involving less code).

                    "body": "<p>What you are looking for is called a <em>spherical covering</em>. The spherical covering problem is very hard and solutions are unknown except for small numbers of points. One thing that is known for sure is that given n points on a sphere, there always exist two points of distance <code>d = (4-csc^2(\\pi n/6(n-2)))^(1/2)</code> or closer.</p>\n\n<p>If you want a probabilistic method for generating points uniformly distributed on a sphere, it's easy: generate points in space uniformly by Gaussian distribution (it's built into Java, not hard to find the code for other languages). So in 3-dimensional space, you need something like </p>\n\n<pre><code>Random r = new Random();\ndouble[] p = { r.nextGaussian(), r.nextGaussian(), r.nextGaussian() };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then project the point onto the sphere by normalizing its distance from the origin </p>\n\n<pre><code>double norm = Math.sqrt( (p[0])^2 + (p[1])^2 + (p[2])^2 ); \ndouble[] sphereRandomPoint = { p[0]/norm, p[1]/norm, p[2]/norm };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Gaussian distribution in n dimensions is spherically symmetric so the projection onto the sphere is uniform.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there's no guarantee that the distance between any two points in a collection of uniformly generated points will be bounded below, so you can use rejection to enforce any such conditions that you might have: probably it's best to generate the whole collection and then reject the whole collection if necessary. (Or use \"early rejection\" to reject the whole collection you've generated so far; just don't keep some points and drop others.) You can use the formula for <code>d</code> given above, minus some slack, to determine the min distance between points below which you will reject a set of points. You'll have to calculate n choose 2 distances, and the probability of rejection will depend on the slack; it's hard to say how, so run a simulation to get a feel for the relevant statistics.</p>\n"

That sounds like a question that could get very complicated very fast especially if you start using, say, great-circle distances rather than Euclidean  distances. But maybe I can answer a simple question, if one converts the points on the sphere to their Voronoi diagram, one can describe each Voronoi cell as having approximately area 4\u03c0/N and one can convert this to a characteristic distance by pretending it&#39;s a circle rather than a rhombus, \u03c0r&#178; =  4\u03c0/N. Then r=2/\u221a(N)."

                    "body": "<h1>The golden spiral method</h1>\n<p>You said you couldn\u2019t get the golden spiral method to work and that\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s really, really good. I would like to give you a complete understanding of it so that maybe you can understand how to keep this away from being \u201cbunched up.\u201d</p>\n<p>So here\u2019s a fast, non-random way to create a lattice that is approximately correct; as discussed above, no lattice will be perfect, but this may be good enough. It is compared to other methods e.g. at <a href=\"https://bendwavy.org/pack/pack.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">BendWavy.org</a> but it just has a nice and pretty look as well as a guarantee about even spacing in the limit.</p>\n<h2>Primer: sunflower spirals on the unit disk</h2>\n<p>To understand this algorithm, I first invite you to look at the 2D sunflower spiral algorithm. This is based on the fact that the most irrational number is the golden ratio <code>(1 + sqrt(5))/2</code> and if one emits points by the approach \u201cstand at the center, turn a golden ratio of whole turns, then emit another point in that direction,\u201d one naturally constructs a spiral which, as you get to higher and higher numbers of points, nevertheless refuses to have well-defined \u2018bars\u2019 that the points line up on.<sup>(Note 1.)</sup></p>\n<p>The algorithm for even spacing on a disk is,</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>from numpy import pi, cos, sin, sqrt, arange\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pp\n\nnum_pts = 100\nindices = arange(0, num_pts, dtype=float) + 0.5\n\nr = sqrt(indices/num_pts)\ntheta = pi * (1 + 5**0.5) * indices\n\npp.scatter(r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta))\npp.show()\n</code></pre>\n<p>and it produces results that look like (n=100 and n=1000):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U7Ut2.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U7Ut2.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Spacing the points radially</h2>\n<p>The key strange thing is the formula <code>r = sqrt(indices / num_pts)</code>; how did I come to that one? <sup>(Note 2.)</sup></p>\n<p>Well, I am using the square root here because I want these to have even-area spacing around the disk. That is the same as saying that in the limit of large <em>N</em> I want a little region <em>R</em> \u2208 (<em>r</em>, <em>r</em> + d<em>r</em>), <em>\u0398</em> \u2208 (<em>\u03b8</em>, <em>\u03b8</em> + d<em>\u03b8</em>) to contain a number of points proportional to its area, which is <em>r</em> d<em>r</em> d<em>\u03b8</em>. Now if we pretend that we are talking about a random variable here, this has a straightforward interpretation as saying that the joint probability density for (<em>R</em>, <em>\u0398</em>) is just <em>c r</em> for some constant <em>c</em>. Normalization on the unit disk would then force <em>c</em> = 1/\u03c0.</p>\n<p>Now let me introduce a trick. It comes from probability theory where it\u2019s known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sampling the inverse CDF</a>: suppose you wanted to <em>generate</em> a random variable with a probability density <em>f</em>(<em>z</em>) and you have a random variable <em>U</em> ~ Uniform(0, 1), just like comes out of <code>random()</code> in most programming languages. How do you do this?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, turn your density into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function\" rel=\"noreferrer\">cumulative distribution function</a> or CDF, which we will call <em>F</em>(<em>z</em>). A CDF, remember, increases monotonically from 0 to 1 with derivative <em>f</em>(<em>z</em>).</li>\n<li>Then calculate the CDF\u2019s inverse function <em>F</em><sup>-1</sup>(<em>z</em>).</li>\n<li>You will find that <em>Z</em> = <em>F</em><sup>-1</sup>(<em>U</em>) is distributed according to the target density. <sup>(Note 3).</sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now the golden-ratio spiral trick spaces the points out in a nicely even pattern for <em>\u03b8</em> so let\u2019s integrate that out; for the unit disk we are left with <em>F</em>(<em>r</em>) = <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>. So the inverse function is <em>F</em><sup>-1</sup>(<em>u</em>) = <em>u</em><sup>1/2</sup>, and therefore we would generate random points on the disk in polar coordinates with <code>r = sqrt(random()); theta = 2 * pi * random()</code>.</p>\n<p>Now instead of <em>randomly</em> sampling this inverse function we\u2019re <em>uniformly</em> sampling it, and the nice thing about uniform sampling is that our results about how points are spread out in the limit of large <em>N</em> will behave as if we had randomly sampled it. This combination is the trick. Instead of <code>random()</code> we use <code>(arange(0, num_pts, dtype=float) + 0.5)/num_pts</code>, so that, say, if we want to sample 10 points they are <code>r = 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, ... 0.95</code>. We uniformly sample <em>r</em> to get equal-area spacing, and we use the sunflower increment to avoid awful \u201cbars\u201d of points in the output.</p>\n<h2>Now doing the sunflower on a sphere</h2>\n<p>The changes that we need to make to dot the sphere with points merely involve switching out the polar coordinates for spherical coordinates. The radial coordinate of course doesn't enter into this because we're on a unit sphere. To keep things a little more consistent here, even though I was trained as a physicist I'll use mathematicians' coordinates where 0 \u2264 <em>\u03c6</em> \u2264 \u03c0 is latitude coming down from the pole and 0 \u2264 <em>\u03b8</em> \u2264 2\u03c0 is longitude. So the difference from above is that we are basically replacing the variable <em>r</em> with <em>\u03c6</em>.</p>\n<p>Our area element, which was <em>r</em> d<em>r</em> d<em>\u03b8</em>, now becomes the not-much-more-complicated sin(<em>\u03c6</em>) d<em>\u03c6</em> d<em>\u03b8</em>. So our joint density for uniform spacing is sin(<em>\u03c6</em>)/4\u03c0. Integrating out <em>\u03b8</em>, we find <em>f</em>(<em>\u03c6</em>) = sin(<em>\u03c6</em>)/2, thus <em>F</em>(<em>\u03c6</em>) = (1 \u2212 cos(<em>\u03c6</em>))/2. Inverting this we can see that a uniform random variable would look like acos(1 - 2 <em>u</em>), but we sample uniformly instead of randomly, so we instead use <em>\u03c6</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> = acos(1 \u2212 2 (<em>k</em> + 0.5)/<em>N</em>). And the rest of the algorithm is just projecting this onto the x, y, and z coordinates:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>from numpy import pi, cos, sin, arccos, arange\nimport mpl_toolkits.mplot3d\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pp\n\nnum_pts = 1000\nindices = arange(0, num_pts, dtype=float) + 0.5\n\nphi = arccos(1 - 2*indices/num_pts)\ntheta = pi * (1 + 5**0.5) * indices\n\nx, y, z = cos(theta) * sin(phi), sin(theta) * sin(phi), cos(phi);\n\npp.figure().add_subplot(111, projection='3d').scatter(x, y, z);\npp.show()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again for n=100 and n=1000 the results look like:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/13o9v.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/13o9v.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jml6W.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jml6W.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<h1>Further research</h1>\n<p>I wanted to give a shout out to Martin Roberts\u2019s blog. Note that above I created an offset of my indices by adding 0.5 to each index. This was just visually appealing to me, but <a href=\"http://extremelearning.com.au/how-to-evenly-distribute-points-on-a-sphere-more-effectively-than-the-canonical-fibonacci-lattice/#more-3069\" rel=\"noreferrer\">it turns out that the choice of offset matters a lot</a> and is not constant over the interval and can mean getting as much as 8% better accuracy in packing if chosen correctly. There should also be a way to get <a href=\"http://extremelearning.com.au/unreasonable-effectiveness-of-quasirandom-sequences/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his R<sub>2</sub> sequence</a> to cover a sphere and it would be interesting to see if this also produced a nice even covering, perhaps as-is but perhaps needing to be, say, taken from only a half of the unit square cut diagonally or so and stretched around to get a circle.</p>\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Those \u201cbars\u201d are formed by rational approximations to a number, and the best rational approximations to a number come from its continued fraction expression, <code>z + 1/(n_1 + 1/(n_2 + 1/(n_3 + ...)))</code> where <code>z</code> is an integer and <code>n_1, n_2, n_3, ...</code> is either a finite or infinite sequence of positive integers:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>def continued_fraction(r):\n    while r != 0:\n        n = floor(r)\n        yield n\n        r = 1/(r - n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the fraction part <code>1/(...)</code> is always between zero and one, a large integer in the continued fraction allows for a particularly good rational approximation: \u201cone divided by something between 100 and 101\u201d is better than \u201cone divided by something between 1 and 2.\u201d The most irrational number is therefore the one which is <code>1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + ...))</code> and has no particularly good rational approximations; one can solve <em>\u03c6</em> = 1 + 1/<em>\u03c6</em> by multiplying through by <em>\u03c6</em> to get the formula for the golden ratio.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For folks who are not so familiar with NumPy -- all of the functions are \u201cvectorized,\u201d so that <code>sqrt(array)</code> is the same as what other languages might write <code>map(sqrt, array)</code>. So this is a component-by-component <code>sqrt</code> application. The same also holds for division by a scalar or addition with scalars -- those apply to all components in parallel.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The proof is simple once you know that this is the result. If you ask what's the probability that <em>z</em> &lt; <em>Z</em> &lt; <em>z</em> + d<em>z</em>, this is the same as asking what's the probability that <em>z</em> &lt; <em>F</em><sup>-1</sup>(<em>U</em>) &lt; <em>z</em> + d<em>z</em>, apply <em>F</em> to all three expressions noting that it is a monotonically increasing function, hence <em>F</em>(<em>z</em>) &lt; <em>U</em> &lt; <em>F</em>(<em>z</em> + d<em>z</em>), expand the right hand side out to find <em>F</em>(<em>z</em>) + <em>f</em>(<em>z</em>) d<em>z</em>, and since <em>U</em> is uniform this probability is just <em>f</em>(<em>z</em>) d<em>z</em> as promised.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"

I apologize that this is such a silly question, but I wanted to show that I've truly looked hard and still come up short.</p>\n\n<p>So, what I'm looking for is simple pseudocode to evenly distribute N points around a unit sphere, that either returns in spherical or Cartesian coordinates. Even better if it can even distribute with a bit of randomization (think planets around a star, decently spread out, but with room for leeway).</p>\n"
