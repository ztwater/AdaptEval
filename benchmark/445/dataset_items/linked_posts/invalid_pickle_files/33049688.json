Thus, to pickle a list, <code>pickle</code> will start to pickle the containing list, then pickle the first element\u2026 diving into the first element and pickling dependencies and sub-elements until the first element is serialized. Then moves on to the next element of the list, and so on, until it finally finishes the list and finishes serializing the enclosing list.  In short, it's hard to treat a recursive pickle as sequential, except for some special cases.  It's better to use a smarter pattern on your <code>dump</code>, if you want to <code>load</code> in a special way.</p>\n\n<p>The most common pickle, it to pickle everything with a single <code>dump</code> to a file -- but then you have to <code>load</code> everything at once with a single <code>load</code>.  However, if you open a file handle and do multiple <code>dump</code> calls (e.g. one for each element of the list, or a tuple of selected elements), then your <code>load</code> will mirror that\u2026 you open the file handle and do multiple <code>load</code> calls until you have all the list elements and can reconstruct the list.  It's still not easy to selectively <code>load</code> only certain list elements, however.  To do that, you'd probably have to store your list elements as a <code>dict</code> (with the index of the element or chunk as the key) using a package like <code>klepto</code>, which can break up a pickled <code>dict</code> into several files transparently, and enables easy loading of specific elements.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20716812\">Saving and loading multiple objects in pickle file?</a></p>\n"
