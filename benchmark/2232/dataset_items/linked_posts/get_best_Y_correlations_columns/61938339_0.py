def remove_collinear_features(x, threshold):
    '''
    Objective:
        Remove collinear features in a dataframe with a correlation coefficient
        greater than the threshold. Removing collinear features can help a model 
        to generalize and improves the interpretability of the model.

    Inputs: 
        x: features dataframe
        threshold: features with correlations greater than this value are removed

    Output: 
        dataframe that contains only the non-highly-collinear features
