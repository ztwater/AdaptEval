def generate_oriented_forest(n):
    """
    This algorithm generates oriented forests.

    An oriented graph is a directed graph having no symmetric pair of directed
    edges. A forest is an acyclic graph, i.e., it has no cycles. A forest can
    also be described as a disjoint union of trees, which are graphs in which
    any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import generate_oriented_forest
    >>> list(generate_oriented_forest(4))
    [[0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 2], [0, 1, 2, 1], [0, 1, 2, 0], \
    [0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
